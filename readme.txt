M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 12 Revision 58 active-X

Update of the BigInteger core functions, to use 1 byte per decimal digit, no 2 bytes (from original programmer Rebecca Gabriella). Also I change the way the string append digits, now done inplace of string (original program make new string for every digit). So now the library is fast enough for the purpose of M2000 Interpreter (for prototyping algorithms and as educational tool)

The first time you run the interpreter do this in M2000 console:
dir appdir$
load info
then press F1 to save info.gsb to M2000 user directory

Read wiki at Github for compiling M2000 from source.
