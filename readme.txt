M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 12 Revision 68 active-X
Bug fixes and some operators works for complex numbers.
1) Works with complex:
 Abs(), Log() (base 10), Ln(), Atan(), Tan(), Cos(), Sin(), Str$(), Round()
2) + * / - ^ or ** for power
3) = or == for equal
4) Complex literals: (1,3i), (a,b i)  (need i with space or no space before if is number).
5) we can mix numbers with complex numbers
