M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 12 Revision 15 active-X
Introduce the Varptr()  (ArrPtr exist as method for RefArray type of arrays). There is a module named VarPtr in Info file which show how we can use the VarPtr to pass pointer of variables by reference for external functions (previous we have to use Buffer (memory block) and pass addresses from that block), or using automatic handle of by reference using &nameofvariable. The varptr can be used for machine code blocks, to return values immediate to variables.
Now Interpreter can get iUnknown objects, from external functions, and soon will be use Interfaces (not just the default one on each object).
